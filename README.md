## Overview
  
<p>This project uses the Shapiro-Wilk test to detect significant deviations from normality. From the <code>scipy.stats</code> library, the <code>shapiro</code> function assesses the normality of a series of data, represented by a <i>p</i>-value. This is accompanied by two visual representations of the data using <code>seaborn</code>'s <code>histplot</code> and <code>scipy.stat</code>'s <code>probplot</code> (QQ plot).</p>

## Instructions

* This is a numbered list.
* I'm going to include a fenced code block as part of this bullet:

    ```Python
    More Code
    ```

* We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   * Like this:

        ```Python
        More Code
        ```

   * The key is to indent your fenced block by **(4 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces.
   * Also need to put a separating newline above and below the fenced block.
